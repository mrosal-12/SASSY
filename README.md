In order to run the code, make sure you have the `streamlit` package downloaded.

To download the package, run the following command:
```console
> pip install streamlit
```

Once the streamlit package is downloaded, run the program with the following command:
```console
> streamlit run app.py
```

This should open up a new browser window where the program will be ran

**Note**: while the program runs in a browser window, it is still locally hosted and does not require internet connection.
